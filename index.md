[A Baseline DSGE model of Climate Change for Climate Policy Analysis](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/109234/)

**Abstract**:This note documents a DSGE model of Climate Change. I extend the NK model with geophisical variables, such as greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon cycle, radiative forcing, and climate change. In this model, I specify five different climate policy regimes: no policy, cap, intensive, tax, and mandate.
